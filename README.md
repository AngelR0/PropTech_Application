## Description
This application contains analysis of the housing rental market data for San Francisco from 2010 - 2016. 

With that information we will analyze the gross rent from different neighborhoods and with that information create a hvplot to compare each housing unit gross rent.

----------------------------------------------------------------
## Installation
This application runs **Python 3.7** and on **PyViz ecosystem**, so we need to install the ecosystem to run the application. 
----------------------------------------------------------------
## How to install
**PyViz ecosystem** in your CLI type:
* ```python
  conda install -c pyviz hvplot geoviews
  ```
  * To confirm the installation type:
    ```python
    conda list hvplot
    conda list geoviews
    ```
----------------------------------------------------------------
## Running the application
When running the application, there will be set of line graphs with a bar graph. The line graphs is to show the growth of the average sale prices, gross rent, and average sale prices per square foot throughout the years from 2010-2016. At the end there will be a geoview of the rental properties and location.
